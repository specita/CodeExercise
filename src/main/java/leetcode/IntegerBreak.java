/**
 * Created by p.chen on 2016/5/9.
 * Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product(³Ë»ý) of those integers.
 * Return the maximum product you can get.
 * <p>
 * For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).
 * <p>
 * Note: you may assume that n is not less than 2.
